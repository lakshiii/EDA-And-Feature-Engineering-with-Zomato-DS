# EDA-And-Feature-Engineering-with-Zomato-DS
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering using the Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant trends, pricing, ratings, and customer preferences. Through data cleaning, visualization, and feature transformation, we prepare the dataset for predictive modeling and deeper analysis.
