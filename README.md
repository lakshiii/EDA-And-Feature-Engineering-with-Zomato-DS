# EDA and Feature Engineering with Zomato Dataset

## 📌 Description
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** using the **Zomato dataset** to gain insights into restaurant trends, pricing, ratings, and customer preferences. Through data cleaning, visualization, and feature transformation, we prepare the dataset for predictive modeling and deeper analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about restaurants listed on Zomato, including:
- Restaurant name
- Location
- Ratings
- Cost for two
- Cuisine types
- Online delivery availability
- Reviews

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following steps are performed to analyze the dataset:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Visualization**: Understanding trends through visualizations.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying anomalies in price, ratings, etc.
4. **Correlations**: Exploring relationships between variables.
5. **Geospatial Analysis**: Studying restaurant density by location.

## 🏗️ Feature Engineering
Key feature engineering techniques include:
- **Encoding categorical variables** (e.g., one-hot encoding for cuisines).
- **Creating new features** (e.g., cost-to-rating ratio, sentiment analysis on reviews).
- **Feature scaling** (e.g., normalization for cost variables).
- **Handling skewness** in numerical features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (for review sentiment analysis, if applicable)

## 📜 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lakshiii/zomato-eda.git
   cd zomato-eda
   ```
